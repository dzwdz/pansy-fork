cat - concatenate files

USAGE
$ cat [ - ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
cat prints the files provided as arguments to its standard out, in order. If no
arguments are given, it will read from its standard input. If a hyphen (-) is
given as one of the arguments, cat will read from standard input until it
encounters an end of file signal. It will then resume printing the remaining
files.
