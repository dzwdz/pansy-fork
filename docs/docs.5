docs - manual documents for the pansy linux system

USAGE
$ [ pager ] /docs/[ doc ].[ section ]

DESCRIPTION
The documents in the /docs directory describe the various parts of the
pansy linux system. They are similar in nature to the man command
commonly found on other Linux systems. The documents are divided into
sections, as can be seen by the number used as a suffix in the
filename. The sections follow the man-page conventions and are as
follows:

1 - Executable programs
2 - System calls
3 - Library functions
4 - Special files
5 - File formats and conventions
6 - Games
7 - Misellaneous
8 - System administration
9 - Kernel routines

The documents are stored in an easy to read, plain text format. This
allows the user to read them in any way they wish, using any pager
they would like.

EXAMPLES
$ p /docs/forth.1
Reading the documentation for the Forth interpreter using the p pager.

$ cat /docs/clear.1
Reading the short documentation for the executable program clear with
cat.
