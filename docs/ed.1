ed - edit text

USAGE
$ ed [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
ed is a line-oriented text editor. It has two modes; a command mode where input
is interpreted as commands for actions (described below) and an append mode
where the input is appended to the file.

EDITING
In the following descriptions, the apostrophes are added for clarity about what
the actual command is. Omit these when typing them into ed.

 - Inputting nothing but a newline will display the contents of the file line by
   line, prefixing each line with its line number.
 - Typing 'p' and inputting a newline will print out the contents of the file
   line by line, but without line numbers.
 - Typing 'a' and inputting a newline  will put you into append mode, where the
   following lines provided as input will be appended to the file. Writing a
   line consisting of a single '.' and inputting a newline will add your changes
   and exit append mode.
 - Typing 'w' and inputting a newline will write your changes to disk.
 - Typing 'q' and inputting a newline will quit ed.

Commands can be prefixed with a number or a range in the form x,y where x and y
are line numbers. This will affect the behaviour of the following command. For
example, if a file consists of the following lines:
    foo
    bar
    baz
    quux

Typing '1p' will print
    bar
as it is the line in position 1 in the file (line numbers are zero-indexed).

Typing '0,2p' will print
    foo
    bar
    baz
since 'p' will attempt to print all lines in the range 0 to 2.
