forth - an interpreter for the programming language Forth

USAGE
$ forth [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
forth is a simple interpreter for the concatenative, typeless programming
language, Forth. It does not conform to any specific Forth standard, but
resembles most other language implementations.
To exit forth, evaluate the word 'bye'.

FILES
    /etc/forth/startup.fs

NOTES
forth has some peculiarities that may be mistaken for bugs. These include:
 - Word definitions being overwritten when they are redefined. This makes a
   feature like the `forget` action not possible.
 - Output from word evaluation will be put on its separate line, unlike other
   Forth implementations which put it next to the input line.

forth is currently a work-in-progress project, and is missing many features.
Some features not yet implemented are:
 - Delimited expressions (like word definitions or printing) that can span
   multiple lines.
 - Variables and constants.
 - User input.
 - A REPL with good interactivity.
 - Floating point numbers and their respective stack.
