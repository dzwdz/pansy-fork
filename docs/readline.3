readline - get a line from standard input

DECLARATION
void readline(char *buf, size_t size);

DESCRIPTION
readline will read size bytes from its standard input or until it encounters a
newline and write these bytes to buf.

EXAMPLE
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <tty.h>
## Is this the correct #include directive? It's "tty.h" on our development side,
## but does it change in the system?

    int main(void) {
        char user_input[256];

        printf("Enter your name: ");
        readline(user_input, 256);

        printf("Hello, %s!\n", user_input);
    }
